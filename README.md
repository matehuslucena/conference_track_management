# CONFERENCE TRACK MANAGEMENT

<b>This project was build to solve this problem below, it was used Java and Junit.</b><br><br> 
You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.

· The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.<br>
· Each session contains multiple talks.<br>
· Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch.<br>
· Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.<br>
· The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.<br>
· No talk title has numbers in it.<br>
· All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).<br>
· Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.
